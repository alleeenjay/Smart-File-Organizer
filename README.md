# Smart-File-Organizer
An app that helps users manage, organize, search, preview, tag, and clean up files on their computer in a simple and modern interface.
# Smart File Organizer

Smart File Organizer is a desktop-first file management app built with **Electron + React + TypeScript**. It scans local folders, indexes file metadata, supports everyday file operations, and provides cleanup/organization workflows like duplicate detection, large-file discovery, empty-folder detection, and rule-based auto-organization.

## 1) Stack Choice and Why

### Chosen stack
- **Electron** (desktop shell + secure native capabilities)
- **React + TypeScript** (maintainable UI and type-safe state/logic)
- **Vite** (fast DX for renderer)
- **Zustand** (lightweight state management)

### Why this is practical
- Works very well on **Windows** today.
- Same Electron architecture can be packaged for **macOS/Linux** with minimal code changes.
- Secure IPC model isolates file-system access in the main process.
- Minimal dependency surface to keep maintenance low.

---

## 2) Architecture Overview

### Process boundaries
**Main process (`electron/`)**
- Owns all direct file-system access.
- Performs scan/index/duplicate detection and file operations.
- Persists local metadata + settings in app data.
**Preload (`electron/preload.ts`)**
- Exposes a small, controlled API via `contextBridge`.
**Renderer (`src/`)**
- UI only (dashboard, file browser, preview, filters, auto-organize).
- Calls secure APIs exposed by preload.

### Security model
- `contextIsolation: true`
- `nodeIntegration: false`
- `sandbox: true`
- Renderer cannot directly access Node APIs.

### Data stored locally
- `settings.json` (scan roots, theme, default view)
- `metadata.json` (tags + favorite flags per file path)

## 4) Features Implemented (MVP + Advanced)

### Core browsing and metadata
- Folder picker + recursive scan.
- Displays: name, path, type, size, created date, modified date, tags, favorite status.
- Sidebar navigation (Dashboard / Files / Auto-Organize).
- Table and grid views.

### File operations
- Create folder
- Rename file/folder
- Move
- Copy
- Delete
- Bulk select + bulk operations

### Organization and cleanup
- Smart category detection by file type
- Custom tags
- Favorites
- Recent files (dashboard)
- Duplicate detection (size + content sample hash)
- Empty folder detection (scan output)
- Large file finder (top large files)

### Search/filter/sort
- Search by filename
- Filters by type, tag, folder, size range (available in state and UI core)
- Sort by name, size, type, modified date

### Preview support
- Image preview (`img`)
- PDF basic preview (`iframe`)
- Text/code preview (`readFile` excerpt)
- Audio/video preview (`audio` / `video`)

### Auto-Organize + undo
- Rule modes: by type, extension, month, year
- Preview move plan before apply
- Apply plan
- Undo latest auto-organize operation

### Dashboard
- Total file count
- Total storage
- File type breakdown
- Duplicate groups count
- Large files count
- Recent activity

## 5) Robust Error Handling

- Scan gracefully skips inaccessible files/folders.
- Operation errors are captured and surfaced in UI.
- Handles permission-denied/locked paths as failed operations without crashing app.
- JSON store parsing failures fallback safely to defaults.

---

## 6) Run, Build, and Setup

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- npm 10+

## Install
```bash
npm install
```

## Run in development
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Build
```bash
npm run build
```

## Preview renderer only
```bash
npm run preview
```

## 7) Implementation Notes and Phasing

This repo is implemented in a runnable MVP-first way, then extended with:
1. scan + list + operations,
2. tagging/favorites + dashboard,
3. preview panel,
4. auto-organize preview/apply/undo,
5. cleanup analytics (duplicates/large/empty).

Potential next improvements:
- richer duplicate hash strategy for very large files,
- saved filter presets,
- virtualized tables for very large directories,
- optional thumbnail caching,
- packaging with electron-builder.

## 8) UI Notes / Screenshot Description

If screenshots are not generated in your environment, expected UI layout:
- Left sidebar with app title, “Choose Folders”, and navigation.
- Files page includes search/filter/sort toolbar, bulk action row, file table or grid, and preview/details panel on the right.
- Auto-Organize page shows rule controls and a move-plan preview list before apply.
+- Dashboard shows summary cards and recent activity list.
